# Excel--Data Analysis Dashboard
This is my first Data Visualization project in Excel.

## Project Overview
You became a franchise owner of Honeybun, a coffee shop chain with three locations across New York City. To better understand purchase behavior and streamline operations, you've collected transactional data from the first half of 2023. Your goal is to transform this data into an interactive, dynamic dashboard that you and other franchise owners can use to identify patterns, trends, and opportunities for the business.

## Objectives
1.	Profile and prepare the raw data for analysis.
2.	Explore the data using Excel pivot tables.
3.	Bring the data to life by designing and building a dynamic dashboard to visualize patterns and trends, ultimately developing actionable recommendations for Honeybun's business.

## Process
- You first explore the coffee shop dataset, conduct some basic data QA and profiling, and add calculated date and time fields to prepare the data for analysis.
- Explore the data using Excel pivot tables.
- Building a Dynamic Dashboard.

## Results/Findings
In Lower Manhattan, 
- Major spike in the Day of Week is Monday.
- Most sales happen between 7 - 10 am.
- Minimal to no sale after 6 pm.
- The most sold product was "Barista Espresso".

## Recommendations
Changing operation hours to 6am - 6pm could possibly increase the margins.
